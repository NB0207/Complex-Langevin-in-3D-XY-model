# Complex-Langevin-in-3D-XY-model

Here is the code for application of Complex Langevin Method for 3D XY model at finite chemical potential. This was an attempt to study the method for 3D XY model reproduce the results of the paper [arxiv:1005.3468](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3468v2). <br/>
This work was done in summer 2021. One can find the report here: [Complex Langevin in 3D XY model](https://web.iisermohali.ac.in/Faculty/anoshjoseph/internships/2021/report_2021_Nikhil_Bansal.pdf).
