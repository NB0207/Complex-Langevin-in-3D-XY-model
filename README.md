# Complex-Langevin-in-3D-XY-model

Here is the code for application of Complex Langevin Method for 3D XY model at finite chemical potential. This was an attempt to reproduce the results of [arxiv:](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3468v2). This work was done in summer 2021. One can find the report here: [Complex Langevin in 3D XY model
